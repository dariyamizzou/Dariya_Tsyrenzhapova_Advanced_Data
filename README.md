Hi Chase, 

My name is Dariya. I am excited to be in your class this semester. 

I am a second-year graduate student majoring in Multimedia Reporting and Data Journalism. My goal for this class is to learn how to scrape data as well as to learn programming tools that would optimize and boost the capacity of journalistic visual storytelling. What are the programming algorithms that can help us simplify the task of analyzing data quickly and efficiently especially if the work has to be done on deadline? What if you donâ€™t have a week to mine through 15,000 rows of data? How to clean it quickly? What are better alternatives to Google Refine? How do you build data viz projects with Python?

I am thrilled to learn new things that will enhance my visual storytelling techniques.

Best,
Dariya
